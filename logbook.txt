Started the project. Added functionality of moving windows to any side of the screen.

While testing the so far basic feature of moving windows, I've found many things that will need to be addressed. Firstly I have to figure out and implement how to make this feature work with multiple monitors as in its current state it's bugged.
Secondly, I've realised some windows have a maximum size limit, for example the windows command line. I don't know how to bypass this, how to maybe override the maximum size limit.
Thirdly, the hotkeys I'm currently using are Left Windows Key + Left Shift (+ and arrow keys for moving windows). The issue here is that Windows by default uses that combination (without the arrow keys) to switch between keyboard languages. At least that's the combination in Windows 7, which is the version of Windows I'm testing this on. The user will either have to make sure to always press the full key combination to not accidentally switch his keyboard language or I will have to find another key combination which is just as handy, and Windows doesn't use it by default. Another regarding the hotkeys is that if the user runs this program, and has already got a program that has this particular combination registered, it will break their program. I will have to give the option for the user to register their own preferred combination.
Fourth, Windows doesn't allow to register hotkeys with more than one normal keys. Normal keys mean any keys that are not Mod keys which are Alt, Shift, Windows key etc. I was hoping I would register the pressing of two arrow keys at once, e.g. up and left arrow, to send a window to the top-left corner. I have to figure out how to achieve this. What I was thinking is: the user would press any arrow key, the program would check to see if the window is at a particular position already and act appropriately. So if the window was at the top side of the screen, the user would press left, it would send the window to the top-left corner. However this solution I imagine would be very messy, and the code I'd end up with would be hard to maintain and not very efficient. I need to look through the winapi to see if Windows has anything like an event handler for keys.

I've addded arbitrary hotkey shortcuts to test whether moving a window to the corners works. It does. The problem is that the shortcut is not used with arrow keys, but somewhere else on the keyboard. I cannot figure out how to implement 8 different shortcuts (4 sides + 4 corners) using 4 keys (arrow keys) as Windows doesnt' allow registering more than one non-modifier key as a shortcut. I've asked about this on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46221188/windows-api-registering-a-hotkey-with-multiple-keys-combination. A user recommended using a low-level keyboard hook. If I don't find any alternative it will be either this, having corner shortcuts somewhere else than the sides shortcuts, which I really would not want, or designing the program in such a way that would require to first send a window to the side to send it to the corner, which is not what I would want either.

I've also might have found a solution to the problem of some windows having a limit on their maximum size. There is a MINMAXINFO structure that I can use to override the minimum or maximum size limit of a window. The question here now is should I let the user resize the window like this? There is potential risk that it might break it. I could also ignore the min max limit and let the user send any window anywhere without overriding it's max size limit. Maybe it wouldn't look good but it would be safe to use. I might also just give the option to the user to set how the program should behave in a case like this and let them decide.
